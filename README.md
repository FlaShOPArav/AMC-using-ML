## 📌 Project Overview

Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a critical function in modern wireless communication systems, enabling intelligent receivers to identify the modulation scheme of a received signal without prior knowledge of the transmitter.  

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**–based approach for AMC using **raw in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples**. The proposed model learns modulation-specific features directly from time-domain signals, eliminating the need for handcrafted feature extraction techniques.
